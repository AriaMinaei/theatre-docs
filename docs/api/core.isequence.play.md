## ISequence.play() method

Starts playback of a sequence. Returns a promise that either resolves to true when the playback completes, or resolves to false if playback gets interrupted (for example by calling sequence.pause())

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
play(conf?: {
        iterationCount?: number;
        range?: IPlaybackRange;
        rate?: number;
        direction?: IPlaybackDirection;
    }): Promise<boolean>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  conf | { iterationCount?: number; range?: IPlaybackRange; rate?: number; direction?: IPlaybackDirection; } |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;boolean&gt;

A promise that resolves when the playback is finished, or rejects if interruped

## Example

Usage:

```ts
// plays the sequence from the current position to sequence.length
sheet.sequence.play()

// plays the sequence at 2.4x speed
sheet.sequence.play({rate: 2.4})

// plays the sequence from second 1 to 4
sheet.sequence.play({range: [1, 4]})

// plays the sequence 4 times
sheet.sequence.play({iterationCount: 4})

// plays the sequence in reverse
sheet.sequence.play({direction: 'reverse'})

// plays the sequence back and forth forever (until interrupted)
sheet.sequence.play({iterationCount: Infinity, direction: 'alternateReverse})

// plays the sequence and logs "done" once playback is finished
sheet.sequence.play().then(() => console.log('done'))
```
