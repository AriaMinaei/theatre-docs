## Ticker.onThisOrNextTick() method

Registers for fn to be called either on this tick or the next tick.

If `onThisOrNextTick()` is called while `Ticker.tick()` is running, the side effect \_will\_ be called within the running tick. If you don't want this behavior, you can use `onNextTick()`<!-- -->.

Note that `fn` will be added to a `Set()`<!-- -->. Which means, if you call `onThisOrNextTick(fn)` with the same fn twice in a single tick, it'll only run once.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
onThisOrNextTick(fn: ICallback): void;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  fn | ICallback | The function to be registered. |

<b>Returns:</b>

void
