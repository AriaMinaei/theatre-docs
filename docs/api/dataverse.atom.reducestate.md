## Atom.reduceState property

Creates a new state object from the current one, where the value at `path` is replaced by the return value of `reducer`<!-- -->, then sets it.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
reduceState: PathBasedReducer<State, State>;
```

## Remarks

Doesn't mutate the old state, and preserves referential equality between values of the old state and the new state where possible.

## Example


```ts
someAtom.getIn(['a']) // 1
someAtom.reduceState(['a'], (state) => state + 1);
someAtom.getIn(['a']) // 2
```
