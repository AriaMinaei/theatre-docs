## ISequence.pointer property

A Pointer to the sequence's inner state.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
pointer: Pointer<{
        playing: boolean;
        length: number;
        position: number;
    }>;
```

## Remarks

As with any Pointer, you can use this with [onChange()](./core.onchange.md) to listen to its value changes or with [val()](./core.val.md) to read its current value.

## Example

Usage

```ts
import {onChange, val} from '@theatre/core'

// let's assume `sheet` is a sheet
const sequence = sheet.sequence

onChange(sequence.pointer.length, (len) => {
  console.log("Length of the sequence changed to:", len)
})

onChange(sequence.pointer.position, (position) => {
  console.log("Position of the sequence changed to:", position)
})

onChange(sequence.pointer.playing, (playing) => {
  console.log(playing ? 'playing' : 'paused')
})

// we can also read the current value of the pointer
console.log('current length is', val(sequence.pointer.length))
```
