## pointer() function

Creates a pointer to a (nested) property of an [Atom](./dataverse.atom.md)<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
declare function pointer<O>(args: {
    root: {};
    path?: Array<string | number>;
}): Pointer<O>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  args | { root: {}; path?: Array&lt;string \| number&gt;; } | The pointer parameters. |

<b>Returns:</b>

Pointer&lt;O&gt;

## Remarks

Pointers are used to make derivations of properties or nested properties of [Atoms](./dataverse.atom.md)<!-- -->.

Pointers also allow easy construction of new pointers pointing to nested members of the root object, by simply using property chaining. E.g. `somePointer.a.b` will create a new pointer that has `'a'` and `'b'` added to the path of `somePointer`<!-- -->.

## Example


```ts
// Here, sum is a derivation that updates whenever the a or b prop of someAtom does.
const sum = prism(() => {
  return val(pointer({root: someAtom, path: ['a']})) + val(pointer({root: someAtom, path: ['b']}));
});

// Note, atoms have a convenience Atom.pointer property that points to the root,
// which you would normally use in this situation.
const sum = prism(() => {
  return val(someAtom.pointer.a) + val(someAtom.pointer.b);
});
```
