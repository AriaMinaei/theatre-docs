|  [createContentOfSaveFile(projectId)](./studio.istudio.createcontentofsavefile.md) | Creates a JSON object that contains the state of the project.

|  [debouncedScrub(threshhold)](./studio.istudio.debouncedscrub.md) | Creates a debounced scrub, which is just like a normal scrub, but automatically runs scrub.commit() after <code>threshhold</code> milliseconds have passed after the last <code>scrub.capture</code>. |

|  [getStudioProject()](./studio.istudio.getstudioproject.md) | Returns the Theatre.js project that contains the studio's sheets and objects.<!-- -->It is useful if you'd like to have sheets/objects that are present only when studio is present. |
|  [initialize(opts)](./studio.istudio.initialize.md) | Initializes the studio. Call it once in your index.js/index.ts module. It silently ignores subsequent calls. |
|  [onSelectionChange(fn)](./studio.istudio.onselectionchange.md) | Calls fn every time the current selection changes. |
|  [scrub()](./studio.istudio.scrub.md) | Creates a scrub, which is just like a transaction, except you can run it multiple times without creating extra undo levels. |
|  [setSelection(selection)](./studio.istudio.setselection.md) | Sets the current selection. |
|  [transaction(fn)](./studio.istudio.transaction.md) | Runs an undo-able transaction. Creates a single undo level for all the operations inside the transaction.<!-- -->Will roll back if an error is thrown. |
