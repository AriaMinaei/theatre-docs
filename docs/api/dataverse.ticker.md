## Ticker class

The Ticker class helps schedule callbacks. Scheduled callbacks are executed per tick. Ticks can be triggered by an external scheduling strategy, e.g. a raf.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export default class Ticker 
```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)()](./dataverse.ticker._constructor_.md) |  | Constructs a new instance of the <code>Ticker</code> class |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [offNextTick(fn)](./dataverse.ticker.offnexttick.md) |  | De-registers a fn to be called on the next tick. |
|  [offThisOrNextTick(fn)](./dataverse.ticker.offthisornexttick.md) |  | De-registers a fn to be called either on this tick or the next tick. |
|  [onNextTick(fn)](./dataverse.ticker.onnexttick.md) |  | Registers a side effect to be called on the next tick. |
|  [onThisOrNextTick(fn)](./dataverse.ticker.onthisornexttick.md) |  | Registers for fn to be called either on this tick or the next tick.<!-- -->If <code>onThisOrNextTick()</code> is called while <code>Ticker.tick()</code> is running, the side effect \_will\_ be called within the running tick. If you don't want this behavior, you can use <code>onNextTick()</code>.<!-- -->Note that <code>fn</code> will be added to a <code>Set()</code>. Which means, if you call <code>onThisOrNextTick(fn)</code> with the same fn twice in a single tick, it'll only run once. |
|  [tick(t)](./dataverse.ticker.tick.md) |  | Triggers a tick which starts executing the callbacks scheduled for this tick. |
