## Box class

Wraps a single value.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export default class Box<V> implements IBox<V> 
```
<b>Implements:</b> [IBox](./dataverse.ibox.md)<!-- -->&lt;V&gt;

## Remarks

Derivations created with [Box.derivation](./dataverse.box.derivation.md) update based on strict equality (`===`<!-- -->) of the old value and the new one. This also means that property-changes of objects won't be tracked, and that for objects, updates will trigger on changes of reference even if the objects are structurally equal.
