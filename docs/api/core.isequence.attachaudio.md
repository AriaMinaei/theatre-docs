## ISequence.attachAudio() method

Attaches an audio source to the sequence. Playing the sequence automatically plays the audio source and their times are kept in sync.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
attachAudio(args: IAttachAudioArgs): Promise<{
        decodedBuffer: AudioBuffer;
        audioContext: AudioContext;
        destinationNode: AudioNode;
        gainNode: GainNode;
    }>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  args | IAttachAudioArgs |  |

<b>Returns:</b>

Promise&lt;{ decodedBuffer: AudioBuffer; audioContext: AudioContext; destinationNode: AudioNode; gainNode: GainNode; }&gt;

A promise that resolves once the audio source is loaded and decoded

## Example 1

Usage:

```ts
// Loads and decodes audio from the URL and then attaches it to the sequence
await sheet.sequence.attachAudio({source: "https://localhost/audio.ogg"})
sheet.sequence.play()

// Providing your own AudioAPI Context, destination, etc
const audioContext: AudioContext = {...} // create an AudioContext using the Audio API
const audioBuffer: AudioBuffer = {...} // create an AudioBuffer
const destinationNode = audioContext.destination

await sheet.sequence.attachAudio({source: audioBuffer, audioContext, destinationNode})
```
Note: It's better to provide the `audioContext` rather than allow Theatre to create it. That's because some browsers \[suspend the audioContext\](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/\#webaudio) unless it's initiated by a user gesture, like a click. If that happens, Theatre will wait for a user gesture to resume the audioContext. But that's probably not an optimal user experience. It is better to provide a button or some other UI element to communicate to the user that they have to initiate the animation.

## Example 2

Example:

```ts
// html: <button id="#start">start</button>
const button = document.getElementById('start')

button.addEventListener('click', async () => {
  const audioContext = ...
  await sheet.sequence.attachAudio({audioContext, source: '...'})
  sheet.sequence.play()
})
```
