## IStudio.debouncedScrub() method

Creates a debounced scrub, which is just like a normal scrub, but automatically runs scrub.commit() after `threshhold` milliseconds have passed after the last `scrub.capture`<!-- -->.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
debouncedScrub(threshhold: number): Pick<IScrub, 'capture'>;
```

## Parameters

|  Parameter | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  threshhold | number | How long to wait before committing the scrub |

<b>Returns:</b>

Pick&lt;[IScrub](./studio.iscrub.md)<!-- -->, 'capture'&gt;

## Example

Usage:

```ts
// Will create a new undo-level after 2 seconds have passed
// since the last scrub.capture()
const scrub = studio.debouncedScrub(2000)

// capture some ops
scrub.capture(...)
// wait one second
await delay(1000)
// capture more ops but no new undo level is made,
// because the last scrub.capture() was called less than 2 seconds ago
scrub.capture(...)

// wait another seonc and half
await delay(1500)
// still no new undo level, because less than 2 seconds have passed
// since the last capture
scrub.capture(...)

// wait 3 seconds
await delay(3000) // at this point, one undo level is created.

// this call to capture will start a new undo level
scrub.capture(...)
```
