- Somehow inline public/theatrejs-logo-currentColor.svg instead of using public/theatrejs-logo-black.svg so that the logo matches the text color (light theme dark theme)
- Make a visual explainer for sheet instancing so that people understand they are like a template
- Add short 2-5s videos for each prop type in the In Depth article (number prop type includes this currently)

- Maybe restructure the end of the getting-started/basics so that programmatic animation, instancing sheets, and prop types are explained before the conclusion?
- Maybe replace "Theatre.js" with "Theatre"?
- Maybe replace "prop" with "Prop"? Other concepts like Sheet, Object, Project, Sequence, etc are capitalized

- Get feedback from users!
